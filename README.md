# DevTools Timeline Viewer for Google Drive

Once the application is authorized, it registers as a Google Drive viewer for`.json` files. 

Then, when opening a json trace file, you can select the Timeline Viewer. It will open in a new tab and load the timeline asset from your Drive.

You can share this URL with any users who 1) have Drive access to the asset and 2) have authorized the timeline viewer app on [chromedevtools.github.io/timeline-viewer/](https://chromedevtools.github.io/timeline-viewer/)
